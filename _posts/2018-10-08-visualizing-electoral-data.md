Numbers and percentages aren't fun to look at, especially when it comes to electoral data. In a political atmosphere filled with dissatisfaction and pessimism, disinterest in the 2018 municipal elections in Tunisia reached unprecedented  levels. To face that, Democracy International opted for a data-driven campaign to help Tunisians get a better understanding of the importance of the upcoming elections and the stakes that are at play.

The campaign used augmented reality, virtual reality, [3D projection mappings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaHDbPP5VJM&t=86s), and interactive data visualizations. Below are three of the visualizations I created within the campaign:


1. <a href="https://mahdiqb.github.io/viz/registeredvoters/" target="_blank">Key statistics about youth's importance to the elections, presented through a scrolling animation</a>

	<!-- <img src="{{ site.img_path }}/3steps/edit.gif" width="75%"> -->

2. <a href="https://mahdiqb.github.io/viz/nidaa/" target="_blank">The movement of Nidaa Tounes deputies from one party to another after the 2014 elections</a>

3. <a href="https://mahdiqb.github.io/viz/assemblee-en/" target="_blank">The deputies of the Assembly of the Representatives of the People, visualized with multiple criteria</a>
